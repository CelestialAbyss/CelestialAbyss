# Hi!

- I am actually a noob when it comes to actual scripting in JavaScript in KubeJS and ZenScript in CraftTweaker despite writing a lot of recipes by hand. 
  - There *might* even be more efficient ways of writing them all.
- Looking for custom Create related recipes? Go here: https://github.com/CelestialAbyss/Create-Customized
- I am not a software engineer!
  - I just happened to pick up programming languages very well because of my understanding of the documentation for [KubeJS](https://kubejs.com/) and [Just-the-Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/). Outside of that I don't have the practical knowledge for JavaScript, Ruby, SCSS, HTML etc. to be able to create things on my own.
- Where is your artwork?
  - Currently not available online, though my butterfly profile picture and Project Vyre logo are some of them.
  - There are now two exceptions for this: the new ModernFix logo and new unofficial KubeJS logo made so it looks good on Devin's badges. I'll provide the badges below so you can see how they look.

## Projects

- [Another Create Wiki](https://github.com/Project-Vyre/another-create-wiki), currently a work in progress and not finished at all.
- [Create Customized](https://github.com/CelestialAbyss/Create-Customized), a repository filled with KubeJS and CraftTweaker examples. Work in progress!
- [Absinthe](https://github.com/CelestialAbyss/absinthe), a fork of [Universalator](https://github.com/nanonestor/universalator) by [nanonestor](https://github.com/nanonestor). I probably shouldn't be diving into this without more experience, but I did want to at least try... üòì
- Currently working on the Finality modpack series, (see below) which intended for Create players and beginners looking to *create* large factories and train networks.

| Modpack Name | Status |
| ------------ | ------ |
| [Finality Omnia](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality-omnia) | Postponed |
| [Finality Tau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality-tau) | Postponed |
| [Finality Genesis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality-genesis) | Priority |

Looking for the Finality modpack and wiki repositories? They are now located here in the [Project Vyre](https://github.com/Project-Vyre) GitHub Organization.

<summary>The actual reason why activity might stop altogether.</summary>
 
I don't really want to talk about my current situation as it might be laughable by some, but I am a bit of a [failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZEaX8a_YU) as an adult despite being what was considered the "gifted and talented" student [through](https://youtu.be/90Fpjwctqlw) elementary, middle school and high school. I even taught how to use Blender 2.8 during my last year in high school in my Digital Arts class.
 
You could say I am bit dysfunctional and running on [fumes](https://youtu.be/6eh39VWPIj4), in other words.
 
All of my work will be transferred to a new owner or become public domain once I am [deceased](https://youtu.be/O7uy4ws5-RU) if I am unable to write a will. There's a lot of things out of my control at the moment.
