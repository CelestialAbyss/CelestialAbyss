# Hello there!

I am actually a noob when it comes to actual scripting in JavaScript in KubeJS and ZenScript in CraftTweaker despite writing a lot of recipes by hand. There *might* even be more efficient ways of writing them all.

Also currently working on the Finality modpack series and [Another Create Wiki](https://github.com/Project-Vyre/another-create-wiki) which is intended for beginners.

<summary>The actual reason why activity might stop altogether.</summary>
 
 I don't really want to talk about my current situation as it might be laughable by some, but I am a bit of a failure as an adult despite being what was considered the "gifted and talented" student through elementary, middle school and high school. I even taught how to use Blender 2.8 during my last year in high school in my Digital Arts class.
 
You could say I am bit dysfunctional and running on fumes, in other words.
 
 All of my work will be transferred to a new owner or become public domain once I am deceased.
