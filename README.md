# Hi!

- I am actually a noob when it comes to actual scripting in JavaScript in KubeJS and ZenScript in CraftTweaker despite writing a lot of recipes by hand. 
  - There *might* even be more efficient ways of writing them all. 
- I am not a software engineer!
  - I just happened to pick up programming languages very well because of my understanding of the documentation.
- Where is your artwork?
  - Currently not available online.

Also currently working on the Finality modpack series (see below) and [Another Create Wiki](https://github.com/Project-Vyre/another-create-wiki) which is intended for Create players and beginners looking to *create* their own custom experience.

- [Finality Genesis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/finality-genesis)

Looking for the Finality modpack and wiki repositories? They are now located here in the [Project Vyre](https://github.com/Project-Vyre) GitHub Organization.

<summary>The actual reason why activity might stop altogether.</summary>
 
I don't really want to talk about my current situation as it might be laughable by some, but I am a bit of a [failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZEaX8a_YU) as an adult despite being what was considered the "gifted and talented" student [through](https://youtu.be/90Fpjwctqlw) elementary, middle school and high school. I even taught how to use Blender 2.8 during my last year in high school in my Digital Arts class.
 
You could say I am bit dysfunctional and running on [fumes](https://youtu.be/6eh39VWPIj4), in other words.
 
All of my work will be transferred to a new owner or become public domain once I am [deceased](https://youtu.be/O7uy4ws5-RU) if I am unable to write a will. There's a lot of things out of my control at the moment.
