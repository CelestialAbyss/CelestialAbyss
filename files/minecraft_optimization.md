- Redirector
- LazyDFU (don't use in 1.20+)
- FerriteCore (required with ModernFix)
- NotEnoughRecipeBook (this was discovered because of a funny incident in voice chat and watching server TPS die due to the vanilla recipe book and player data, thank <@930222347166818404>  for mentioning this)
- ImmediatelyFast (though it *can* definitely cause issues so use at your own risk)
- Starlight (don't use in 1.20+ but can still break lighting)
- Canary (fork of Lithium, but has bugs so **use at your own risk**)
- Better chunk loading by someaddon (Predictive chunk loading based on player movement and more)

There's others like AI Improvements... (let me find that list brb)
